------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Warning: You are running an unofficial Flatpak version of Code::Blocks IDE !!! |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please open issues under: https://github.com/flathub/org.codeblocks.codeblocks/issues


This version is running inside a container and is therefore not able
to access SDKs on your host system!

This flatpak provides a standard development environment (gcc, python, etc).
To see what's available:

  $ flatpak run --command=sh org.codeblocks.codeblocks
  $ ls /usr/bin (shared runtime)
  $ ls /app/bin (bundled with this flatpak)

To get support for additional languages, you have to install SDK extensions, e.g.

  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.dotnet
  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.golang

To enable selected extensions, set FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT environment variable
to a comma-separated list of extension names (name is ID portion after the last dot):

  $ FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT=dotnet,golang flatpak run org.codeblocks.codeblocks

To make this persistent, set the variable via flatpak override:

  $ flatpak override --user org.codeblocks.codeblocks --env=FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT="dotnet,golang"

You can use

  $ flatpak search <TEXT>

to find others.
