 This version is running inside a container and is therefore not able
 to access SDKs on your host system!
 
-To execute commands on the host system, run inside the sandbox:
-
-  $ flatpak-spawn --host <COMMAND>
-  
-To make the Integrated Terminal automatically use the host system's shell,
-you can add this to the settings:
-
-  {
-    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
-      "host-bash": {
-        "path": "/usr/bin/flatpak-spawn",
-        "args":  ["--host", "--env=TERM=xterm-256color", "bash"]
-      }
-    },
-    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "host-bash"
-  }
