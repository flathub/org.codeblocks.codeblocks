| Warning: SDK was updated to 24.08 ! |
---------------------------------------

Code::Blocks IDE flatpak platform was updated to a new major version.

You may need to
- Install updated SDK extensions for matching version (e.g. `org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.node10//24.08`)
- Reinstall PyPI, CPAN and RubyGems packages (due to interpreter major version change)
- Rebuild your projects and their dependencies (due to ABI incompatibility between SDK versions)
