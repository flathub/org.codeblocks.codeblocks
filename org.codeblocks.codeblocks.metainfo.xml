    <p>
     Code::Blocks is a highly extensible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
     for the C, C++ and Fortran programming languages. It features support for 
     a wide range of compilers, parallel builds, multi-target projects, and also 
     provides an interface with GNU GDB.

    <p>
     Note: Code::Blocks runs in an isolated space from the main system, it has the 
     tools provided by the SDK and its extensions, it also has a plugin that can
     be installed to add more dependencies. More information at
